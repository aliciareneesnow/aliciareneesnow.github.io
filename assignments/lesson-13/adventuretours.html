        <p>Over the course of 6 days, you'll pedal right from the backdoor of the Canvas hotel on over 100k of the singletrack that dreams are made of. Ride along the lakes and across the sweeping granite domes that characterize this unbelievable landscape, while you drink straight from the icy mountain streams and gaze at a night sky clearer than any you've seen before. In between your explorations, relax at the exclusive Canvas hotel, a hidden retreat tucked away in the moors of Norway. This mountain bike tour to the north country will be one to remember.
